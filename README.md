# Bandwidth-IQ
Bandwidth IQ (Kotlin/Compose MVVM) is a proactive network analyzer. It performs accurate, native API speed/ping tests and acts as a System Speed Analyzer (charts/history). The UI features a real-time Speedometer and a chat-style UX. It sends crucial system notifications when network quality changes, giving you advice e.g "Time for 4K streaming!".
